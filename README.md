# 3D Zork Unity

### What is 3D Zork?
3D Zork unity is the product of a challenge I set for myself: build a Unity game in five days.

It is a Unity port of a game originally made by https://github.com/mdepp and myself five years ago, itself based on the text adventure Zork I.

Most of the textures and sounds a came from other games (I use them here for educational purposes only) however the level editor was custom built (hence why the levels look so crappy).
